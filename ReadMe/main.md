> This is the main controller script that calls and execute functions in all the other R scripts
## Important Points
1. All the input are stored in the *input* within the text files with **-** sign between the LHS and RHS of the functional dependency
2. Input files are already created within the *input* folder, you may directly write your functional dependency within the file **(Do leave a new line at the end of the file)**
3. After cloning the repository please do change the directory in *setwd()* accordingly.
4. If you wish to execute the codes separately do remove the first comment line of *setwd()* and update the path accordingly in few of the files
